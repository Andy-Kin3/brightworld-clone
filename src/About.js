                    emergency response system</h1>
                    The need for humanitarian assistance especially in hard
                    to reach communities is on the increase thus informing
                    the need for a prompt, reliable and context relevant

                    • Prompt: Ensuring that the needs of individuals and

                    empowerment strategy</h1>
                    The contribution of youths to development is quite low in most
                    developing countries. This is as a result of limited holistic capacity
                    building and development opportunities. The educational system
                    is job focused and limited in its ability to groom youths to be
                    problem solvers.<br/>

                    stimulating youths to invest in practical community oriented
                    solutions.<br/>

                    documentation service</h1>
                    We live in a society with limited development communication
                    structures that capitalizes on transformational development
                    efforts. This informs the need to invest in the design and
                    production of contextualized content to inform development
                    orientations.<br/>
                    <h3>Strategic actions includes;</h3>
                    • Setup structure for the conception, design and production of
                    inclusive development oriented Information, Education and

                    communication products.<br/>
                    <h1>5. Sustainable resource pool for community development</h1>
                    Current funding for community development initiatives in most cases
                    targets needs to satisfy funder requirements. In most cases, the priority
                    needs of the communities are missed out or not considered. Our
                    resource mobilization strategy, seeks to raise resources to respond to
                    the primary and emerging needs of individuals and communities
                    promptly.<br/>
                    <h3>Our strategic actions includes:</h3>
                    • Setup a reliable platform to receive and manage donations from
                    individuals and organizations.<br/>
                    • Organize targeted fund raising campaigns to meet the

                    program that engages passionate youths in to
                    community service</h1>
                    Volunteerism which is an age strategy for experience building and
                    community impact remains an under exploited avenue in our
                    society. Youths have little exposure and understanding on the
                    benefits of volunteerism. Thus the need for a well-developed
                    community centric volunteerism program that identifies, link and
                    support youth engagement.<br/>
                    <h2>Our strategic actions are;</h2>

                    <h1>7. Strong partnerships and collaborations for
                    sustainable community impact</h1>
                    Most development organizations operate independently of
                    others. This results to lots of duplication of efforts, wastage of
                    resources and limited impact. Solving community problems
                    requires a multi-sectorial intervention engaging and benefiting
                    from the potentials of different development actors. Our strategy
                    targets partners at the global, regional, national and local levels
                    built upon shared principles, values, and goals.<br/>
